## Technologies

- [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - Facebook's popular JavaScript front-end framework.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Our runtime server uses Node.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) - A backend framework for Node.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Our database uses Postgres.
- [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - Facebook's generator (think boilerplate, but more) in response to critique of React being difficult to learn.
- [Docker](https://docker.com) - Deployment tool from the gods.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Webpack acts as a module bundler and almost entirely dispenses with the need for a task runner, like Grunt or Gulp.
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - JavaScript compiler to unify all the different versions of JS that may have been used or will be used in the future.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Facebook's open source JavaScript package manager. There are a few differences between Yarn and Node Package Mangaer (npm), but the main differentiation is that Yarn locks dependencies so your project doesn't break when external resources change their code.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - While Yarn is handling our projects dependencies, we still use npm to run scripts as you'll see further below.
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com) - CSS Preprocessors make stylesheets faster to develop and easier to maintain.
