# Spoke



#### Overview:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This solution aims to solve the issue presented by Chris Sjoblom regarding Local Government Engagement among the community. It incorporates an aggregated database, API Calls and Gateways, both a web and mobile friendly interface so as to provide a simple, streamlined and powerful experience for those that wish to have their issues heard. We incorporated a voting system that will have a threshold trigger for a set number of up-votes that will send a email and/or push notifications to selected members of the Eugene Local Government for review. The overall goal and intention of this project is to integrate the community in a way that they can make their issues known and heard in  public manner outside of City Council Meetings. The Spoke name and logo is derived from the conceptual belief that all members of a community are interconnected like the spokes of a wheel. By being interdependent, all issues that individuals believe are important can be brought to the front and solved by the community while creating continuous movement forward in the local area.


### Technology Used For This Project:

1. #### Back end:
  * Amazon Web Services
  * API GATEWAY
  * Lambda  
  * Dynamo DB

  ###### Description:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Amazon is a highly scalable and low cost service host. Through them, we are able to use their API Gateway service that allows for the Frontend and Mobile application to use Restful standards which allows future developers to contribute along with current developers.

2. #### Frontend:
  * Material Design
  * Web components
  * Polymer

  ###### Description:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The Polymer framework, a framework provided by Google, is an environment that allows for progressive web applications to be realized. This application was made with a "Mobile First" approach so that the initial and continued user experience(s) are smooth, fast, and if needed, usable from any browser.

3. #### Mobile:
  * React native

  ###### Description:
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  The React-Native Framework allows for the development of both Android and IOS applications as a base functionality in a more streamlined fashion than traditional application creation. Due to the structure of the framework being primarily JavaScript, the perceived technological debt will be mostly JavaScript across all platforms. This also has the added benefit of only requiring those developers working on this project in the future to be literate in JavaScript.



## Potential growth:
  1. #### Support and Application:
      * **Added Support** for non Android and IOS devices allows for more connectivity and usability within the community.
      * **Automated Reports** delivered to administrative members via email and/or push notifications that are triggered due to threshold markers.
      * **Localized Heat Mapping** and map integration that provides demographics related to participants and reported issues via Geo Tagging.
      * **Social Sharing** via social media, SMS services, and E-Mail. Allows for issues to be shared on integrated media platforms as well as through text message and Email services.
      * **Augmentation and Testimonial Support** allows users to upload related media in the forms of photographs and video for greater depth of detail in regards to current issues.

  2. #### Communication and Involvement:
      * **Contact Information** of city council members aggregated from public sources. Provides personal correspondence and greater depth of detail on local issues unavailable in the public circuit.
      * **Threading for Similar Issues** allows for differing perspectives of issues to be centralized as well as indicate level of urgency based on number of appended posts.
      * **Volunteer Workforce Meetups** allow members to form groups to solve public issues that are deemed safe to handle as well as create volunteer organizations such as a Citizen Action Committee.




### Summary:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This application provides a solution to the issue presented by Chris Sjoblom regarding Local Government Engagement among the community by providing a user friendly application which will allow members of the community that wish to have their issues heard. With this application, users will be able to communicate concerns and suggest solutions to community problems to the City Council without having to physically be present. The City Council members will also be able to consider more input from community members on issues that are important to them, as well as help set priorities for City Council agendas.
