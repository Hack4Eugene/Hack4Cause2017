# Hack for a Cause2017 Team "Soundwave"

We are addressing the "Hult Center" challenge with a visual exploration of universal themes
featuring audience participation and vocal performance. The application we have prepared is an interactive sound-driven illustrated scene. For the challenge we will present "A Fire in the Storm". A magical story emerges based on audio input from the performers and audience.
